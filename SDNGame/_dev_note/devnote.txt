[x] make window (gl or glfw) (note from future: fuck that glfw, those binding were buggy as fuck, switched to gl based window gen)
[x] implement rendering unit (buffer, vertex array, shader)
[x] make basic shape (hello world triangle)
[x] implement quad shape
[x] add texture drawing (on triangle, quad and other primitive shape)
[x] add code abstraction (based on silk .net demo) 
[] add xml comments 
[x] implement sprite rendering system (sprite batch, sprite properties, etc)
[x] use separate sprite state class for sprite properties instead of built-in properties manager due to 'cOdE bLoCk' 
[x] steal camera class from silk .net demo for the sprite renderer
[x] fix "matrix4 shader uniform not found" error
[x] refactor camera class (make it 2d since the code that was stolen from silk .net demo is for 3d)
[x] fix viewport zoom position below (0, 0)
[x] fix viewport buggy positioning and rotation
[x] update camera2d method name typo
[x] refactor camera translation method
[x] fix viewport rotate viewport position to screen center (fixed by chatgpt, and yes you heard that shit right, i cheated)
[x] prototype wave player (base on silk .net demo)
[x] refactor spritestate (fixing bug related to camera2d)
[x] refactor spritebatch (fixing bug related to camera2d)
[x] remove hardcoded buffer/vertex_arr generation on sprite renderer (will use the one from rendering unit instead)
[x] bounce basic shaders to legacy shader unit (since we no longer use them and will only keep as reference)
[x] add dedicated renderer (dgpu) support (only nvidia for now)
[x] add amd dedicated renderer support
[x] denesting graphics initializer (factoring issues)
[] test dedicated renderer compatibility (amd gpu for testing is demanding...)
[] add intel dedicated renderer support (or shouldn't? like the intel gpu are mostly igpu so why would implement a dgpu support for it?)
[x] implement a cool splash screen on startup
[x] fix non-transparent splash window (change api binding to win32 perhaps?)
[x] animating splash screen with fade in/out fx
[] abandon splash fade fx (ps: nah i fixed it)
[x] refactor wave player (add abstraction)
[x] implement audio mixer
[x] fix null wave player list (declare nullable)
[x] implement simple input manager
[x] update input manager method name
[x] add key binding processor
[x] implement entity component system (like unity)
[x] make a simple game (human vs bounce ball kinda shit tho)
[x] implement ttf/otf text renderer
[x] fix unproper text renderer crop
[x] refactor code base structure
[x] implement custom multimedia game timer
[x] refactor game timer and fix failed winmm dlls import
[x] implement post-processing effect
[x] fix post-processing effect low density bug
[x] fix font rendering truncation bug
[x] implement tween (easing functions) class
[x] implement scene manager
[x] implement scene transition (fade, zoom, etc)
[x] advanced scene transition (fancier version of previous transition effects)
[x] improve shape renderer corner calculation
[x] fix line shape render faulty vertex offset
[x] create some demo scene
[X] implement ui elements
[x] add gamepad/joystick input support
[x] refactor input manager (add support + key/input mapper)
[x] add mp3/ogg audio format support
[x] refactor audio entire audio namespace
